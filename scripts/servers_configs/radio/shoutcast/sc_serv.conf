; ScreenLog controls whether logging is printed to the screen or not

; W3CEnable turns on W3C Logging.  W3C logs contain httpd-like accounts

; RelayPort and RelayServer specify that you want to be a relay server.
; Relay servers act as clients to another server, and rebroadcast.
; Set RelayPort to 0, RelayServer to empty, or just leave these commented

; AdminPassword.  This password (if specified) changes the
; behavior of Password to be a broadcast-only password, and
; limits HTTP administration tasks to the password specified
; here.  The broadcaster, with the password above, can still
; log in and view connected users, but only the AdminPassword
; will grant the right to kick, ban, and specify reserve hosts.
; The default is undefined (Password allows control for both 
; source and admin)
AdminPassword=%pass

; AutoDumpUsers controls whether listeners are disconnected if the source
; stream disconnects.

; AutoDumpSourceTime specifies how long, in seconds, the source stream is
; allowed to be idle before the server disconnects it. 0 will let the source
; stream idle indefinately before disconnecting.

; ContentDir specifies the directory location on disk of where to stream
; on-demand content from.  Subdirectories are supported as of DNAS 1.8.2.

; IntroFile can specify a mp3 file that will be streamed to listeners right
; when they connect before they hear the live stream.
IntroFile=

; BackupFile can specify a mp3 file that will be streamed to listeners over
; and over again when the source stream disconnects. AutoDumpUsers must be
; 0 to use this feature. When the source stream reconnects, the listeners
; are rejoined into the live broadcast.

; TitleFormat specifies a format string for what title is sent to the listener.

; PublicServer can be always, never, or default
PublicServer=default

; AllowRelay determines whether or not other SHOUTcast servers will be
; permitted to relay this server.
AllowRelay=Yes

; AllowPublicRelay, when set to No, will tell any relaying servers not
; to list the server in the SHOUTcast directory (non-public), provided
; the relaying server's Public flag is set to default.
AllowPublicRelay=Yes

; MetaInterval specifies how often, in bytes, metadata sent.

; ListenerTimer is a value in minutes of maximum permitted time for

; BanFile is the text file sc_serv reads and writes to/from

; RipFile is the text file sc_serv reads and writes to/from

; to connect to this server (useful for relay servers).
; This file is automatically generated via the web
; interface.
RipFile=sc_serv.rip

; RIPOnly, when set to Yes, will only allow IP addresses listed in the Reserved

; CpuCount is used to explicitly limit the DNAS to dominating a finite
; amount of processors in multiprocessor systems.

; Sleep defines the granularity of the client threads for sending data.
; DNAS 1.7.0, per client thread, will send up to 1,024 bytes of data
; per socket (or less depending on the window available), and then
; sleep for the provided duration before repeating the whole process.
; Note that making this value smaller will vastly increase CPU usage on 
; your machine.  Increasing reduces CPU, but increasing this value too far 
; will cause skips.  The value which seems most optimal for 128kbps 
; streaming is 833 (833 microseconds per client poll) on our test labs.
; We wouldn't recommend setting it any lower than 100, or any higher than 
; 1,024.

; CleanXML strips some whitespace and linefeeds from XML output which
; confuses some (poorly written) XML parsers.  If you get XML rendering errors,
